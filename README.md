## Welcome to Minipicture.me
This is a Rails application that is inspired by the famous existing image sharing website, [Instagram](http://instagram.com/). The existing Instagram website is great, but there are certainly more improvements to make (e.g., uploading images from the website, browsing images in a slideshow fashion, and many cool features).
